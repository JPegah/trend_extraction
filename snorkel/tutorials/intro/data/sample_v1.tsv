201601182414.html	'document By Mohammed Bello Tukur Protocols, I wish to extend appreciation to the government and people of the Republic of Mali for hosting this conference to look at a framework for better policies in support of pastoralism and livestock production in West and Central Africa. For me personally being in Mali is always a great pleasure, It is like re-connecting with history in this land of great scholars, great griots, historical monuments, extra-ordinary musicians and the great river Niger. Mali holds a special place in my heart and so does it the history of our continent. This conference on pastoralism is coming after the ECOWAS High Level Meeting on Climate Change which took place here in Bamako, in June, 2015. As we say in Fulfulde: "Nagge Accata Yettugo, Pullo Accata Yettugo Nagge." "The cows cannot thank the grasses enough, and pastoralists cannot thank the cows enough". So we cannot say thank you enough to Mali for hosting us again and showing a high level of commitment to the issues of pastoralism in the Sahel, despite the security challenges. I also express our appreciation to the technical and financial partners who supported the organising of this conference and pastoralists and Farmers\' organisations present here. There is a renewed interest by our governments, regional organisations, technical, financial and financial partners for a better understanding of pastoralism in the face of many daunting challenges. As we all know, pastoralism is a strategic mode of mobile livestock care adopted by pastoralists based on risk management, adaptability and resilience in difficult environments. I hope this renewed interest, understanding and support will lead to improved livestock production, food security for our populations, economic growth, peace and prosperity. The challenges of pastoralism are many. Some of these include more border consciousness with regards to transhumance and cross-border movements amongst nations and communities, climate change, insecure land tenure, intense competition for use of natural resources between crop producers and pastoralists, violent conflicts, infiltration of violent actors and proliferation of small and light weapons, rural banditry and cattle rustling. Also, the lack of access to medical care for human beings and veterinary care for the herds, educational marginalisation, lack of access to markets, trans-border animal disease, insurgencies in parts of the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin countries, rural-urban migrations, and migration to Europe by mainly the youth populations, poverty and impoverishment, and the gender question. As such, this conference is unique in that it has brought together pastoralists and farmers, technical, financial and development partners, regional organisations, governments and other critical stakeholders with a view to finding a sustainable way for pastoralism and having a viable livestock production system in the face of the challenges listed above. I hope this conference will come up with a clear road map for our policy-makers and development partners in finding lasting solutions to overcome these challenges. There are several declarations, policies and proposed action plans that have been captured on paper and some translated into action to overcome the challenges of pastoralism and make it better. These include the Africa Union Policy Framework on Pastoralism; ECOWAS Strategic Action Plan for the Development of Livestock in West Africa under ECOWAS Agricultural Plan, 2011; the Nouakchott and Ndjamena Declarations on Pastoralism, 2013; the World Bank Programme for the Support of Pastoralism in the Sahel (PRAPS), the proposed Food Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Action Plan for Transhumance in West Africa, among many others. Regional pastoralist civil society organisations like ROPPA, CORET, APESS and RBM need to assess how far these programmes have impacted on pastoralists and livestock production in the region, what the success stories are and which areas need improvement. I urge participants to take this into cognisance in making recommendations in this conference. Finally, I hope this conference will put in a place a mechanism of sustained collaboration and cooperation between pastoralists, farmers, fisher-folks and other natural resource users so that they we can speak with one voice to improve food production, food security, sustainable livelihoods and peace in our regions. Once again accept my appreciation for the opportunity to speak here. On behalf of all the pastoralists organisations in West and Central Africa I say "Mi yetti, Sakiraabe, Reubhe eh Worbhe". Thank Ladies and Gentlemen. Mohammed Bello Tukur, a Lawyer, is the Acting Secretary General of the Confederation of Traditional Herder Organisations in Africa (CORET). @Pastoralist1 on Twitter. This was a Keynote address delivered at the International Conference for Sustainable Pastoralism in West and Central Africa, held in Bamako, Mali on January 7, 2016..'
201608040677.html	'Photo: Dangote Aliko Dangote BILLIONAIRE Nigerian investor Aliko Dangote\'s plans for US$1 billion worth of investment in Zimbabwe could go up in smoke after the country\'s Immigration Department denied visas to aides he wanted to dispatch into the country to expedite progress, the Financial Gazette can exclusively report. The decision could be a result of factional fights within President Robert Mugabe\'s government, torn by internecine bickering between a faction linked to Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa and another fighting to thwart any prospects of him succeeding the incumbent in the event that he leaves office. Mnangagwa is said to be vigorously pushing for Dangote\'s investment plans. In terms of the country\'s visa regime, Nigeria is under Group C classification, meaning that citizens of that country must obtain visas first before they enter Zimbabwe. While the Zimbabwe Investment Authority (ZIA) has already issued the requisite permits for the Dangote Group to start work, it is critical that the group deploys its best brains on the ground to monitor the various stages of implementation. Currently, the group is seized with preliminary activities such as geological surveys for its coal and cement projects. Although the Financial Gazette could not immediately get a comment from the Dangote group, an official from ZIA, Farai Sadomba, confirmed the development. "Yes, Dangote has met with difficulties in acquiring visas from the Immigration Department for his technical team to get into Zimbabwe," Sadomba said in a terse response to the newspaper\'s enquiry. She declined to give any details. ZIA is a statutory body created to promote and facilitate both local and foreign direct investment. It emerged from the amalgamation of the Export Processing Zones Authority and the Zimbabwe Investment Centre as government sought to create a one stop investment shop for quicker and easier facilitation of foreign investment. When Dangote visited the country last year to explore investment opportunities, he met President Mugabe and promised to pour in over US$1 billion for a power generation plant, a coal mine and a cement manufacturing plant that would cost US$400 million. It would be much bigger than all the plants held under the group\'s Dangote Cement. The three projects were meant to commence early this year but Dangote had clearly indicated that this would depend on the issuance of relevant permits, for which he said government had already promised to "accelerate" all approvals. But it would appear organs of the same government are throwing spanners in the works. Immigration principal director, Clemence Masango, demanded questions in writing when asked why they had denied visas to Dangote\'s technical team. But he has not yet responded to questions sent to him on Tuesday. While this would be shocking, it is not surprising: Ravi Jaipuria, the Indian billionaire planning to set-up a US$30 million bottling plant in Zimbabwe that would create 400 thousand jobs and at least 1 500 others downstream, had to personally seek President Mugabe\'s help after his project was held back by bureaucratic bungling. Jaipuria last week visited the country to finally witness the release of a long-awaited certificate of compliance by the Harare City Council. Last month, the Financial Gazette reported on disclosures by deputy secretary to the President and Cabinet, Ray Ndhlukula, that Korea-based manufacturing giant, Samsung\'s plan to set up a television and refrigeration assembly plant in Zimbabwe nearly collapsed due to corruption and bureaucratic bungling in government. Ndhlukula told captains of industry that he has sought the intervention of Mnangagwa to save the deal. Apparently, the country is battling against high unemployment, estimated at nearly 90 percent. Dangote\'s planned projects are expected to create hundreds of jobs and inject desperately-needed cash into the economy, which is struggling with a liquidity crunch that has almost completely ruined the economy. Dangote\'s is estimated to have a fortune amounting to US$17,2 billion by Forbes magazine. The Nigerian billionaire has interests in manufacturing and power generation. Dangote Cement has been on a major expansion programme in Africa, with huge investments in Zambia and Cameroon last year alone. In Zambia, the group commissioned a US$420 million cement manufacturing plant and a 30MW coal-fired plant; it commissioned a US$250 million 1,5 million metric tonnes per annum cement plant in Douala, Cameroon. The Zambia investment saw cement prices in that country almost halving, and further declines are anticipated..'
200606290856.html	b"book review By Reviewed by Shadrach A. Ambanasom Title: Walls of Agony Author: John Ngong Kum Ngong Publisher: Editions CLE Yaounde, 2006, 60pp. A Cameroonian educationist, John Ngong Kum Ngong, has enriched our literary landscape with two new imaginative works.They are Battle for Survival (June 2006) a play, and Walls of Agony (June 2006) a collection of 40 poems. For now, I am concerned with the latter, putting on hold the former. Walls of Agony has as its general subject matter the post-colonial Cameroonian society which the poet criticizes and educates. Cameroon emerges from the poems as a society composed of people of various cultural and ethnic background. But instead of this cultural multivalence becoming a source of strength and a potential for positive change, it translates into a narrative of national anomie, an occasion for the construction of walls of incomprehension and misery. The poet's anger is directed against all those who erect these polyvalent tribal walls of division and misunderstanding between the superior Self and the inferior Other. His ire is aimed at those who fan the flames of tribal Manicheism ('The Battle continues', 'Powerless'). The Cameroon that the poems examine is a country blessed with many natural resources which are unfortunately mismanaged by a few privileged citizens to the detriment and misery of many. The poet pictures the country as having been ruined and destroyed by the profligate few but one that needs to be rebuilt by real patriots. It is in the dimension of reconstruction that the poet situates his role and that of genuine nationalists. On the whole the poet is pre-occupied with familiar themes like exploitation, deprivation, marginalisation, cruelty, insatiable greed, corruption, indecency, injustice and exclusion etc. It is axiomatic that the essence of poetry is imagery, the use of figurative language. Ngong Kum's collection is highly figurative, particularly with regard to the use of metaphor. The human leeches, the parasites and destroyers of the country are metaphorically read as 'caterpillars on our grazing land' (43); 'greedy dogs' (24); 'grey-haired sharks' (24); 'human locusts' (41); 'fleas and rats' (32); 'worms' (54); 'maniacs' (24); 'cursed castrated curs' (29), etc. This use of emotive language shows the poet's anger and critical attitude towards his subject matter. However, the author does not only deconstruct; he reveals his desire to reconstruct, to rebuild what has been destroyed. While he is critical, the poet eschews runaway radicalism or outright recourse to violence as a means of reconstructing a new Cameroonian society. He believes the law can be invoked for the redress of some of the social ills, ('Ridiculous Walls').In places the poet's critical but patriotic tone of voice becomes combative. He sounds like a man of action, a fighter. But his weapon is neither the spear nor the gun, but rather the barrel of the 'pen' which be intends to use to 'fire' our 'brains' so that 'those who career with justice / Will for sure join the rescue team / That will give our country a new face' ('Ridiculous Walls'). He entreats his ancestral supreme deity, Kezeh, to give him artistic wisdom to reform his Cameroonian society, 'A brush and paint for reconstruction' with which 'to challenge corruption to combat and batter the heart of exploitation' ('Better than Flight'). He appeals to Kezeh to 'Mould me into a fine poet / That my songs may my people revive' ('Let me in'). It is logical that a man as committed as the poet is will not look kindly on those who refuse to speak out against societal ills. Indeed he criticises those who remain silent in the face of social injustice and misdemeanour; that is, 'those who still do not see / The folly of not speaking out' (53). He believes that he and his generation will be held accountable to history, to posterity ('Touch Down' and 'The Combatant'): Your children will be ashamed When the story will be told Of how you shamelessly backed down From the position you took To combat cutthroat exclusion 'The combatant' The poet thus encourages those who matter to join him in condemning the moral wrongs of society in the hope of eventually reforming it. He urges citizens to play an active, positive role in constructing 'walls' of understanding while demolishing those of incomprehension. The poet wishes he were thunder and lightning so that he could raze to the ground all symbols of retrogression and underdevelopment; he wishes he had the magic balm with which to sanitize his morally sick society; he wishes he could reinvent the Cameroonian society 'to trace a new path for us' ('Take Heart'). Written in free verse and accessible language, Walls of Agony is very readable. In it the poet effectively exploits sonal services, especially the use of alliteration. His poetic style is economical, his poetic line very tightly controlled, with no unnecessary words and expressions. The poet's sentiments are mature and sincere, and his moral intentions for his country, honourable. The social relevance of this collection resides in the fact that it is a soulful, patriotic appeal for the rebuilding of a beloved and richly endowed country ruined by all kinds of petty-minded people who privilege mean projects and pursuits and divisive, egotistic tendencies above concern for the commonweal and love for the fatherland.

201509072138.html	'opinion Did President Muhammadu Buhari make specific promises to be realised within his first 100 days in office? This is the kernel of a raging controversy between the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), writes Onyebuchi Ezigbo No doubt, the observance of 100 days in office has become a common ritual among political office holders in Nigeria and elsewhere in the world where democracy is practiced. In Nigeria, the celebration of 100 days has become a ritual especially among those manning the executive arm of government. Most people and political analysts tend to use milestones attained by various administrations to read the pace of governance and to also assess whether a leader is moving in the right direction or not. Most often, elected leaders try to have a good start and to use the 100 days milestones as publicity stunt to enhance government\'s popularity among the people. However, the challenge of achieving an impressive 100 days target can be very daunting and often times may lead to controversies. It is against this background that the 100 days in office of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has generated public debate. The bone of contention has been whether President Buhari had promised Nigerians that he would achieve specific things within his first 100 days in office. Critics of the Buhari administration have pointed to the document tagged "One Hundred Things Buhari Will Do in 100 Days" and another one, "My Covenant With Nigerians" and are using it to assess what his administration has been able to achieve so far. PDP and its leaders are in the fore front of the critics of the APC administration, accusing it of not doing much since it took office at the center, more than three months ago. The party said the shambolic state of the nation\'s economy within the period, which represents the worst in the nation\'s contemporary history, is a direct fallout of uncertainty created by the inability of the Buhari-led government to chart a clear-cut economic policy, worsened by abuse of regulations, and flagrant violation of constitutional provisions. It cited alleged decline in Nigeria\'s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by about 2.35 percent, while at the same time claiming that job creation has dropped by 69 percent. In the statement issued by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Chief Olisa Metuh, the opposition party said instead of gains, official reports show that the last three months under the APC-led government havd brought a sudden decline in the nation\'s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with attendant losses and hardship to the citizens, while the government embarks on propaganda of imaginary achievements, in addition to attempts to foist harsh economic regime to cover its ineptitude. "If not for crass incompetence or a possible ulterior motive to subjugate Nigerians for selfish reasons, what else explains the adamant stance of this administration in running a government without the statutory components of a full cabinet and precise fiscal policy direction, even when the negative consequences of this strange totalitarian approach are taking serious toll on the economy and the polity in general? But the APC and President Buhari have come out to debunk insinuations being made about the 100 days in office and other allegations of poor performance. Regarding the issue of the document \'My Covenant With Nigerians\' and the one that contained the things Buhari allegedly said he will do in 100 Days, the Senior Special Assistance to the president, Mallam Garba Shehu maintained that they did not emanate from the authentic channel of the campaign\'s media department. Shehu urged Nigerians to ignore the claims that the president specifically made promises of achievements within his 100 days in office, adding that he never authorised or signed any document in this regard in his capacity as the Director, Media and Communications of the Buhari Campaign Organisation. While reflecting on what the president said during his well- advertised lecture at Chatham House in London before the elections, the presidential spokesman said: "The president never promised anything to anyone. It is on record in that lecture at Chatham House they asked him a question relating to expectations and what he specifically would do in relation to certain documents that were flying around, committing him to this thing or that thing within 100 days. In that lecture - the video is already now viral on the web - he (Buhari) said \'it contained falsehood and I am not going to engage in deceit. I will go in there, I will see what is there and get the intelligence - the knowledge of things that are going on - and I will fully commit myself to serving Nigeria\'." What Buhari Promised to Do Although Buhari may not have committed himself to meeting specific targets in his 100 days as is evident from his speech at Chatam House prior to the election, he did raise the hopes of Nigerians and non-Nigerians alike who listened to his presentation. Buhari promised to among other things clip the wings of the terrorist gang, Boko Haram and prevent them from ever occupying any Nigerian territory. The president also told the international community that in dealing with the security challenges in the north east, he would initiate comprehensive economic development plan promoting infrastructural development, job creation, agriculture and industry in the affected areas. "Let me assure you that if I am elected president, the world will have no cause to worry about Nigeria as it has had to recently; that Nigeria will return to its stabilising role in West Africa; and that no inch of Nigerian territory will ever be lost to the enemy". Speaking on the current dwindling oil prices that have brought about economic and social predicament, Buhari said his government would embark on multiple reform in the oil and gas and also refocus attention on agriculture as an alternative source of revenue. "We would embark on multiple tracks reform in the oil & gas sector especially the government institutions like the NNPC to block revenue transmission leakages and make them more efficient and accountable. "We must stop paying lip service to agriculture by taking practical and concrete steps to restore it to its glorious position as the mainstay of our economy providing employment, food for our teeming population as well as leading foreign exchange earner. On agricultural policy, Buhari said he will provide farmers with a dignified living through improved inputs, extension services, access to credits and price support mechanisms. We would re-vitalize the agricultural sector and make it the engine of growth, and source of job and wealth creation. Some of our policy thrust would include Agricultural Enterprises Value Chain and Cluster Development for commodities, and institutional framework and support for agribusiness investment. In this regard, the Abuja Commodity Exchange shall be reinvigorated and supported. "We shall embark on a National Infrastructural Development Programme that will promote road, air and water transportation in the country to make Nigeria a hub of the West African Sub Region. "We shall decisively bring the Boko Haram insurgency to an end and promote lasting peace and stability in all the nooks and crannies of our nation. We would ensure that the victims of the insurgency are adequately rehabilitated and supported to restore their means of livelihood. "We shall make accountability and transparency the hallmarks of our administration by ensuring that resources are well utilized through plugging all loopholes and eliminating wastages and corruption in governance. Anti corruption agencies shall be strengthened and given free hand to operate in discharging their statutory mandate, " he said. The President\'s Senior Special Assistant on media, Garba Shehu choose to play with semantics, saying Buhari\'s first 100 days in office are the "milestones" reached within the period under review, rather than "achievements"., Shehu went further to list Buhari\'s Scorecard Within 100 Days, breaking them in various sectors. Security President Buhari ordered the relocation of military command to Maiduguri. The courageous and visionary decision took the war against terrorism right to the door steps of Boko Haram, recording amazing results of conquest against insurgency, release of captured villages, freeing of largely women and children and restoration of hope of an end to terrorism. -The President championed the creation of the Multinational Joint Task Force, which will create a ring around terrorists with the cooperation of the Lake Chad Basin Commission and Benin. The Lake Chad Basin Commission military deployment has already attracted donations, military platforms and more shared intelligence -To further give a bite to the Multinational Joint Task Force, President Buhari ordered the release of $21m to facilitate the establishment of the headquarters of the force in N\'Djamena -The United States also pledged $5 million to the fight against Boko Haram, in addition to other material support. -President Buhari altered the strategy against Boko Haram by changing the service chiefs, and ensuring that the entire operation gets daily monitoring with the military heads now based in Maiduguri. -Following the President\'s visit to Germany, where he attended a meeting on the invitation of the G-7, world leaders opened a new leave of diplomatic relationship with Nigeria, promising technical and material support to quell Boko Haram, and rebuild the Nigerian economy. -To strengthen the nation\'s security architecture, President Buhari approved the recruitment of 10, 000 into the Nigerian Police. This will complement the President\'s vision of building a robust and responsive domestic security outfit. Economy At the outset of his administration, President Buhari approved an intervention to pay all the public servants owed salaries across the states due to fall in revenue sharing. The President\'s intervention was principally to alleviate the suffering of many Nigerians and reduce the level of poverty. Apart from the intervention, the monthly Federation Accounts Allocation Committee witnessed a substantial jump in the month of July, 2015, largely due to the plugging of leakages. The jump was in spite of fall in oil revenue. It said electricity has improved significantly since the President assumed office on May 29, 2015. The 4,600 megawatts has ensured longer hours of light and lesser light cuts. Also the scorecard claimed that the country\'s foreign reserve has improved to $31.5 USD in spite of the falling global prices of commodities. From an initial $29.2 USD the Foreign Reserve grew to $31.5, further securing the economy against global and domestic shocks. According to the Presidency, the change in the leadership of the NNPC was a major stride in the restructuring the organization. The appointment of a new Group Managing Director and the slice of Executive Directors from eight to four by the President had repositioned the organization. Closely linked, it said was the abandoned refineries in the country which have now started operations. Warri and Port Harcourt refineries had started operation at 60 percent capacity, hoping to close-up after a Turn Around Maintenance (TAM). Subsequently, it said fuel queues had gradually faded around the country, especially in Abuja and Lagos where the queues lasted for a while after the inauguration. In addition, the administration gave credit to President Buhari for ordering a fast-track of Ogoni clean-up and acting on a United Nations Environmental Project Report that had been long delayed by previous administrations. "To further demonstrate his penchant for fairness and justice, the President directed the CBN to clear all the outstanding allowances of former militants studying in various institutions across the world. The delay in payment of allowances had left the entire Amnesty Programme hanging on a cliff. President Buhari also salvaged the Amnesty Programme from near collapse by changing the leadership, and giving it a new vision of catering for the weak, the poor and the vulnerable, instead of enriching a few. A move that was well received by the people in the Niger-Delta. President Muhammadu Buhari has ruled out the appointment of a government delegation for this year\'s pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. By this decision, the government saved about one million U.S dollars and N30m in local expenses. Corruption Striking at the heart of corruption, President Buhari ordered the closure of all multiple accounts in MDAs and a reduction to the use of Single Treasury Account to promote transparency and accountability. After three days in the United States, President Buhari was able to harmonize the relationship with the United States, which faltered greatly under the previous administration As a fallout of the visit, the United States has promised more support for Nigeria in terms of technical, military and intelligence support to nail insurgency in the north east. The United States has also released evidence of massive looting and links of monies wired out of the country to the President in the United States. The President has directed prosecution. The meeting in the United States also attracted N2.7 trillion investments into the country. On corruption, the impression of the President as incorruptible and the fear of prosecution pushed many to return stolen public funds, with reports saying key actors in the previous government have returned huge sums of money. The President set up an advisory committee on war against corruption to design an effective template for fighting corruption President Buhari\'s leadership has been religiously focused on cutting down the cost of governance while channeling scarce resources to the areas of priority, thus, government\'s official travels have been reviewed so that public officers no longer embark on frivolous foreign trips. The administration has cancelled oil swap deals that had cost the country billions of dollars; resulted in fuel queues due to differences in figures and muddled the country\'s reputation due to multiple interpretations and reported high level corruption. The total monetary value of all finished goods and services produced in Nigeria in the second quarter of 2015 recorded a 2.57 percent growth, says data on Quarterly Gross Domestic Product estimates of the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics. In real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 90.20 percent to the nation\'s overall GDP, marginally higher than both the 89.55 percent share recorded in the first quarter of 2015, and 89.24 percent recorded in the corresponding period of 2014. Indeed, Buhari may have avoided falling into the trap of committing himself to 100 days specific targets but his party and his campaign organization cannot in all honesty exonerate themselves from the documents flying around in which they made several pledges including the ones that fell within the first 100 days in office. Even though the presidency and the party can conveniently disown such campaign document, that cannot remove the fact that some of the mouth-watering promises may have formed the basis for which many Nigerians cast their votes for APC and President Buhari during the last general election and should not be dismissed with a wave of the hand..'
201602161488.html	'The United Nations has released 58 million U.S. dollars to assist 2.4 million people affected by Boko Haram-related violence in 2015. A document made available to the News Agency of Nigeria by an official of the Public Information in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Kate Pond, said the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) allocated the said amount from March 2015 to February 4, 2016. "Since 2015, the Emergency Relief Coordinator has released more than 58 million U.S. dollars from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) for life-saving assistance in response to Boko Haram-related violence. "The sum of 27.2 million U.S. dollars was allocated in March 2015 to assist more than 1.6 million internally displaced persons, refugees, returnees and host communities from Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. "An additional 31 million U.S. dollars was provided in late 2015 and early 2016 for life-saving humanitarian response for more than 700,000 affected people in the Lake Chad Basin region," it said. It also explained that with the support of CERF\'s rapid response funds, humanitarian partners had been providing life-saving assistance and protection for the most vulnerable people. "The sum of 13.5 million U.S. dollars was provided to assist 350,000 displaced persons who fled from border areas and vulnerable host communities in Niger. "Also, 20 million U.S. dollars was spent to assist over 1.6 million internally displaced persons and vulnerable host communities in Nigeria. "The sum of 10.5 million U.S. dollars was released to assist over 187,000 vulnerable internally displaced, returnees, refugees and third country nationals in Chad. "It included host community members in Chad in need of urgent protection, health, nutrition and food assistance, as well as Non-Food Items (NFIs), shelter and education. "The sum of 14.1 million U.S. dollars was provided to assist the over 248,000 newly displaced, vulnerable host community members, and women and children at risk of abuse and forced recruitment by Boko Haram in Cameroon," it added. The document also explained that CERF was one of the fastest and most effective ways to support rapid humanitarian response for people affected by natural disasters and armed conflicts. It said the funding support, which is managed by the UN OCHA, receives voluntary contributions all year round from UN member states and Observers, regional governments, private sector, foundations and individuals. "This money is set aside for immediate use at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources," it said. (NAN).'

201504061698.html	"opinion By Oskar Semweya-Musoke March 2015 ended with a bang! Retired General Muhammadu Buhari beat incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in the general elections to win the Nigerian presidency. Buhari certainly deserves heartfelt congratulations; it is not easy winning an election against an incumbent president anywhere in the world but everyone knows it is harder in Africa! Buhari also had the extra baggage or burden of his own history as a military dictator who overthrew an elected government and ruled Nigeria with an iron hand. Even though he was commended for intolerance to corruption, he was never forgiven for his crusade against 'indiscipline' in which media freedom was killed, opposition politicians jailed and citizens beaten by the military when they did not line up at bus stops. Renowned writer Wole Soyinka has advised Nigerians to forgive Buhari in a Mandela-like way. It seems that the citizens had already forgiven him anyway since he had lost in the three previous elections. Or have Nigerians chosen austerity and tough measures? One has to remember that this election was postponed and pushed six weeks ahead just days before it was to be held in January. It does not help that the boss of the Independent National Electoral Commission, commenting on the body's preparedness, made a mistake by saying that even the results were ready! The reason for postponement was Boko Haram, the terrorist outfit that has tortured Nigeria for six years now. Buhari has promised to wipe them out in months after taking over the presidency and perhaps he is believed because of his tough military background. Did Goodluck Jonathan lose because he was seen as weak, having failed to defeat the Boko Haram, refused US help and then finally succumbed to seeking aid from poor neighbours including Chad and Cameroon? Now tough measures are required in Kenya where suspected terrorists attacked a university in the north last week. By the end of the gruesome siege, the death toll was 150 people including students who were in class studying and others sleeping in dormitories. Garissa, the town in which the university is located, has been prone to al-Shabab attacks because of its proximity to the Somali border. So it is not clear why the university had only two policemen guarding the university. On the other hand, Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta has taken a tough stance on corruption by naming all of 140 public servants and politicians, including ministers, as suspects of corrupt activities. Nearly all have been asked to 'step aside' as investigations are being conducted, a first for Kenya. Of course in Uganda we know about stepping aside and we may not believe that it yielded useful action against corruption. Whilst austerity and tough measures are sought after in Nigeria and Kenya, few believe that it will be a vote winner in the UK come voting day in May 2015. On March 30, the British prime minister visited the queen to officially dissolve parliament, a tradition that marks the start of the election campaign period. The programme leading up to election day was published earlier and on April 2, all the seven contestants participated in a live television debate, the first of many. Whilst the British economy has recovered lately thanks to the Conservative government in power, it seems that their tough austerity measures will hurt them in the elections. Opposition parties yonder are hammering away at that point especially concerning the reducing public services as a result of expenditure cuts. Interestingly, the British election campaign period is just over a month long and probably the cheapest in the world. It is thought that this time round, the Brits are keen to vote and that the field is open to another round of power sharing hence the seven contestants. Whilst the Nigerian election process seemed ugly especially after the postponement, the country has turned out to be a shining beacon for other African countries to emulate. And this is not because the opposition won. Voting was extended into the next day to allow everyone a vote, the process was transparent and President Jonathan has emerged as a great statesman! Not only did he concede early, he called Buhari congratulating him and urged all his supporters to accept the result without bloodshed! A Nigerian friend informed me that he had not had reason to feel proud about being Nigerian since winning the African Champions Football tournament - these elections have provided another moment! Our own Electoral Commission has published a calendar of events leading to February 2016 beginning in October. Shall we be proud Ugandans after the elections? The author is one of the founding Kigo thinkers.."
201510160313.html	'Photo: Dangote Aliko Dangote. analysis By Shame Makoshori When Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote arrived in Zimbabwe last month, the red carpet was rolled out for Africa\'s richest man. He was showered with exclusive hospitality and access to ruling elites, including meetings with the two Vice Presidents Emmerson Mnangagwa and Phelekezela Mphoko before seeing President Robert Mugabe. He may have never attracted such attention elsewhere across Africa. All the same, this was understandable. Africa\'s richest man had stepped into a country whose leaders have run out of ideas about how to repair the extensive damage now threatening to ground a once promising economy following years of mismanagement and corruption. Zimbabwe is at the crossroads. Only a few meaningful investments have taken place in the past decade after hundreds of firms folded under difficult conditions. Thousands more have divested to avoid expropriation by government through its controversial empowerment laws. So when Dangote announced that he had "already made the decision to invest" in the country, the drums beat even loudest among politicians, who anticipated that his proposed multi-million dollar investment would arrest one of the most devastating crises to hit the southern African nation, where dwindling State revenues, firm closures, declining disposable incomes, rampant looting and social exclusion is the order of day. But last week, Dangote inadvertently dropped the bombshell. In an interview with the news agency, Reuters, the billionaire listed Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast and Zambia as his next investment destinations. More on This Africa\'s Richest Man to Invest in Zimbabwe Dangote Secures Investment Licence Dangote Wastes No Time, Technocrats in Zimbabwe to Seal Deals How Mahachi Brought a Billionaire Investor to Zim Can Dangote Save Zimbabwe? He did not mention Zimbabwe, where he had promised to start projects next year during his Harare visit. Has he suddenly forgotten about Zimbabwe? This is most unlikely. But if he has put his back to the country, it could be time for self-introspection. What is it that could have forced the billionaire to develop cold feet? Dangote with Tourism Minister Walter Mzembi Godfrey Kanyenze, executive director at the Labour and Economic Development and Research Unit of Zimbabwe, pointed to several concerns that could have made Dangote\'s team of experts, which visited the country a week after his departure, to advise otherwise. "You will be a hero of an investor to come to invest (in Zimbabwe) when companies are closing," said Kanyenze. "What I know is that investors are coming to check the environment. They have problems with the environment and they are only coming here with a futuristic view. We are so desperate that sometimes what we may perceive to be real investment could be investors who are just mapping the environment," Kanyenze said. In last week\'s interview, Dangote said his Nigerian Stock Exchange-listed conglomerate planned to build cement plants elsewhere and omitted Zimbabwe where he had promised to pour over US$400 million into a cement plant with a capacity to produce 1,5 million metric tonnes per year. "Another plant will be launched in the Democratic Republic of Congo next year," said Dangote, whose sprawling conglomerate has oil, gas, telecommunications and real estate interests. He will be expanding his sugar business into Zambia, where he already has a cement plant. Economist, Witness Chinyama, said Zimbabwe still had a real chance of attracting Dangote to invest. He said after the billionaire came to Zimbabwe, licencing issues must have been done quickly to get him down to work. "He had made up his mind," said Chinyama. "We must give him the licences to start operating. What have we done since he came here?" Chinyama asked. The Nigerian billionaire had made bold moves to crack into the Zimbabwean market despite concerns from other investors unhappy with the country\'s restrictive laws, which limit them to a maximum of 49 percent shareholding in local firms. In the past week, new Empowerment Minister, Patrick Zhuwao, has made chilling statements about his intention to press ahead with the policy despite earlier signals government was slowly reviewing the controversial policy. Authorities, battling to stop an economic meltdown that has sparked divestment and massive job losses, had indicated that a raft of laws that made Zimbabwe less attractive to investors would be reviewed. An unprecedented sudden drop in electricity generation has now hit the country, placing investors in a more precarious situation. Industries and domestic consumers are enduring long periods of blackouts, with load shedding of up to 18 hours. Kanyenze said this was bad news to any efforts to lure foreign investment. "Do we have the power? You (the media) are reporting that water levels in Kariba are dropping. Another drought is looming. We need US$15 billion for power projects. This is not charity, investors come where there is a good (investment) climate," he said. Dangote is also certainly not a charity investor..'
201710050361.html	'The Federal Government has said that Nigerians from are united in their resolve to defeat the Boko Haram terrorist group. Hussein Abdullahi, former Under-Secretary, Regions and International Organisations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated this while delivering Nigeria\'s statement on \'Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism\' at the UN headquarters, New York. Mr. Abdullahi regretted that Nigeria was confronted with the challenge of terrorism as manifested in the brutality of Boko Haram activities against the population. He said, however, the Nigerian Government introduced many measures to fight the terrorist group from different fronts and in compliance with human rights obligations in the fight against terrorism. "In August, 2016 President Muhammadu Buhari launched the revised National Counter-Terrorism Strategy, NACTEST and urged Nigerians to team up to win the psychological battle against terrorism. "The President called for multi-sectoral collaboration and urged all government establishments to cue into NACTEST for maximum achievements. "The revised strategy was meant to confront the dynamism of the perpetrators and involve all stakeholders in the battle by encouraging Nigerians to unite against terror in spite of their religious, tribal and political leanings. "Since the president\'s launch of this revised National Counter-Terrorism Strategy, Nigerians have equipped themselves psychologically to win the war against the terrorist group. The strategy succeeded in uniting Nigerians from all walks of life towards defeating Boko Haram. It also encourages religious leaders to use their various places of worship to enlighten their followers through a change of mindset to embrace morality and love of God," he said. Mr. Abdullahi said with the measures taken by Nigerians and the Federal Government in confronting the Boko Haram terrorist organisation head-on, their activities had been completely degraded. "Nigerian forces have been able to clear Boko Haram out of many areas in the North-east by reclaiming territories captured by the organisation and restoring peace and stability in the affected states. "Today, residents in the North-eastern states now move about their daily businesses in relative safety," he said. According to him, Nigeria has trained and equipped the military forces in counterterrorism and counter-insurgency on subjects ranging from urban patrol to unarmed combat and humanitarian law. He said the Special Forces of the Nigerian military had been training a mobile strike team of some officers of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps and the Nigerian Police. "As an additional measure, Nigeria has developed a huge capacity for the prompt and timely prosecution of Boko Haram suspects. "This has been made possible by the establishment of a Complex Case Group to specifically address all terrorist-related matters. "The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force of the UN has successfully trained many government officials in the areas of human rights, rule of law and counter-terrorism," he said. The Nigerian official also said that there was a programme for de-radicalisation, rehabilitation, reorientation and re-integration for repentant Boko Haram suspects. "In order to assist the victims of Boko Haram, the government initiated a Victims Support Fund and the Presidential Initiative for the North-east as well as the Safe Schools Initiative. "These initiatives have facilitated the provision of humanitarian relief, socio-economic stabilisation and resettlement of persons displaced by the terror organization. "It is remarkable to note that Nigeria has indeed recorded significant progress in the fight against terrorism through international cooperation from some friendly countries around the world," Mr. Abdullahi said. He pointed out the closer cooperation Nigeria enjoyed with its neighbours, Cameroon, Chad, Niger Republic and the Benin Republic, within the framework of the Lake Chad Basin Commission to form a Multinational Joint Task Force, MNJTF. "Consistent with our faith in the need for a collective fight against terrorism, I like to re-affirm Nigeria\'s commitment to work closely with all UN counter-terrorism entities. "These include the United Nations Centre for Counter-Terrorism as well as the Centre and the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force," Abdullahi said..'
201510191146.html	'Fifa\'s ethics watchdog on Monday banned Thai football chief Worawi Makudi for 90 days as acting president Issa Hayatou delayed his arrival at football\'s corruption-hit ruling body by 24 hours. The ethics committee said it had moved to sideline Worawi "on the grounds that a breach of the Code of Ethics appears to have been committed and a decision on the main issue may not be taken early enough." Worawi was a Fifa executive committee member for 18 years until May and has faced multiple allegations of wrongdoing. He was found guilty in July by a Thai court of forgery in his reelection as head of the Football Association of Thailand. Monday\'s ban follows matching suspensions handed out to beleaguered outgoing Fifa president Sepp Blatter and European football boss Michel Platini last Thursday. Fifa\'s acting president Issa Hayatou had been set to turn up at Fifa\'s Zurich headquarters to assume command on Tuesday, but the 69-year-old African football boss\'s arrival is "now expected on Wednesday", a Fifapress spokesperson told news agency AFP. He was appointed caretaker boss of Fifa in his capacity as its oldest serving vice-president. Hayatou was in his native Cameroon at the weekend, and has since moved on to the Gabon capital Libreville to take charge of a Confederation of African Football meeting. Blatter was relieved of his duties by the ethics committee as Swiss prosecutors investigate him for criminal mismanagement. The 79-year-old, who was due to stand aside from the organisation he has run since 1998 in February, is appealing his suspension. On Sunday, a defiant Blatter told Swiss weekly Schweizer am Sonntag: "I\'m a fighter. They can destroy me, but they can\'t destroy my life\'s work." Platini, the UEFA president and a front runner to succeed Blatter, is also appealing his ban. The former French football legend has denied any wrongdoing in accepting a 1.7 million euro payment from Fifa in 2011 for consulting work he undertook years earlier and called the ban "farcical." European football\'s ruling body is holding crisis talks Thursday to discuss Platini\'s plight followed by a press conference. The seemingly never-ending turmoil at the top of football has prompted a hastily-convened meeting of Fifa\'s executive committee on October 20. And some reports suggest one topic on the menu will be the delaying of the February 26 election to find Blatter\'s replacement, following Platini\'s ban and the six-year suspension meted out to another potential presidential candidate, South Korea\'s Chung Mong-joon. But the Fifa spokesperson said: "Up to now there has been no official request for that." The deadline for would-be candidates who must have the backing of five football federations, is on October 26. Fifa\'s Reform Committee meanwhile is due to hold a three-day session starting Friday in Berne. This is the second time the committee set up in August and presided over by Swiss lawyer Francois Carrard, has met. A third meeting is planned after which it will present its proposals to overhaul the sleaze-tainted organisation..'
201601251979.html	"opinion By Sophie Kamya We've barely had time to wrap our heads around the scale of corruption in world football governing body, Fifa and now have to come to terms with another massive scandal involving the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), following a damning report that top officials took bribes to cover up positive doping results, mostly from Russian athletes. Russia has since been expelled from international athletics while former IAAF President, Lamine Diack was arrested and charged with corruption along with other key figures involved in the cover-up. And now we're learning of wide spread match-fixing in Tennis, according to claims by a former player. Tennis regulators are dismissing the claims but after World No 1 Novak Djokovic revealed this week that he was offered $200,000 in 2007 to lose a match, I don't for a second doubt that some players have or are losing games on purpose. We have a serious problem now that sport is more about money than sportsmanship. As the popular saying goes, God made man, man made money and money corrupted man. Greed and betting companies are at the core of this problem and no sport is safe. Pakistan bowler, Mohammad Amir who has been serving a five-year-ban for match-fixing just returned to action. American sprinter Justin Gatlin who has served two doping bans is also competing again. Fellow American, Lance Armstrong who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles following his 2013 doping admission is now trying to get his lifetime cycling ban lifted and I wouldn't be surprised if he succeeds and is allowed to compete again. That's how low sports has sunk. I remember feeling embarrassed and disappointed on learning that several African teams were more keen on getting their appearance fees and bonuses than winning matches during the 2014 World Cup. Cameroon's Squad refused to travel to Brazil until their bonuses were increased. Ghana's players threatened to strike before their game against Portugal and we all heard about the $3 million cash flown to Brazil to appease the players and I believe those Asamoah Gyan selfies with some of the cash weren't photoshopped! Nigeria's players also refused to train until their bonuses for advancing to the round of 16 were paid. All this while players from Greece requested Antonis Samaras, their Prime Minister at the time to use their bonuses to build a new training centre for the National Team. You can clearly tell who would easily be lured into fixing matches and who plays for country. I'm not saying sportsmen and women shouldn't be compensated as this is their job and most of them put in a lot of hard work but I just want them to remember that they have fans. There are diehards who save for years so they can watch at least one world cup game live. While most athletes have their accommodation, travel and other expenses taken care of by sports authorities in their respective countries, spectators often foot their own bills, so for you to get on to the track, pitch, court or wherever your particular sport is played and lose on purpose is not just unfair but wrong. Personally, I now can't look at comebacks or even upsets without wondering whether money didn't have something to do with it.."
201312040155.html	'Photo: Transparency International The dominant red colour of the circle in this graphic shows how corrupt most African nations are perceived to be. Several African nations were among the worst performers in Transparency International\'s annual report on perceived corruption. Somalia was one of three nations receiving the lowest score in the report released Tuesday by the corruption watchdog group. The report gave each nation a score between 0 and 100. Besides Somalia, African countries that scored 20 or below on the list include Sudan, South Sudan, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Chad and Eritrea. Only three African nations received scores above 50 - Botswana, Cape Verde, and Rwanda. Transparency International says Africa has improved on indicators related to "human development and sustainable economic development." The Berlin-based group says, however, there has been a "noticeable deterioration" in terms of safety and the rule of law. Transparency International Executive Director Robert Barrington said countries suffering from conflict, such as Somalia, are the worst performers. Barrington said Rwanda\'s score has improved because its government has made a concerted effort to fight corruption. Denmark and New Zealand topped the list with scores of 91.

200606051122.html	"By Leocadia Bongben Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, President of Cameroon's National Assembly, indirectly referring to the SDF, has described the crisis and recent violence rocking the party with the recent loss of life, as a backward step in democracy. He decried what he said was lack of democratic culture demonstrated by the SDF at the opening ceremony marking the beginning of the second ordinary session of the National Assembly last June 1. The President condemned violence, describing the situation as unacceptable in modern times, as it provides room for violence in politics, which are at variance with the virtues of social harmony, upheld by parliamentarians. Saying that there is a dire need to defend the democratic culture, the President identified debate in the National Assembly as indispensable and urged politicians to be vigilant and anticipate events. With the session opening 34 days after Cameroon attained the completion point of the HIPC-I, Cavaye Yeguie took the opportunity to join the ban wagon to pledge the support of the Parliamentarians to the Head of State. He attributed this achievement to hard work and greeted the spirit of endurance by Cameroonians. He charged the Parliamentarians to take their responsibility in explaining the implications of the completion point to the masses. He deplored corrupt practices, calling on Cameroonians to shun such behaviour and unite forces for the development of the country. Maintaining that there is no progress without hard work, Cavaye hammered on rigorous management of public funds and morality in the execution of projects, saying that it is an obligation in the domain of management. Referring to the May 20 celebrations weeks before the session, Cavaye Yeguie saluted Cameroonians for demonstrating their commitment to peace and the desire to live together, stating that dialogue is the force of argument. The opening session was marked by calm, with the absence of the usual jeers and clapping that has characterized the Assembly business of recent, safe for a rare bang on the table.."
201509151162.html	"opinion By Olalekan Bilesanmi President Muhammadu Buhari clocked 100 days in office last Sunday. His inauguration as the fourth President since 1999 came with a lot of promises. One of his first actions was the ordering of the country's military command to Maiduguri, the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurgency. The decision took the war against terrorism right to the door steps of Boko Haram, recording amazing results of conquest against insurgency, release of captured villages, freeing of largely women and children captives and restoration of hope of an end to terrorism. In order to freeze thr activities of the terrorists, Buhari made diplomatic shuttle to the countries under the Lake Chad Basin Commission and Benin Republic. The shuttle ultimately produced the Multinational Joint Task Force, which will create a ring around the terrorists. The Lake Chad Basin Commission military deployment has already attracted donations, military platforms and more shared intelligence. To further give a bite to the Multinational Joint Task Force, the President ordered the release of $21m to facilitate the establishment of the headquarters of the force in N'Djamena. The United States of America, USA, also pledged $5 million to the fight against Boko Haram, in addition to material support. This, in addition to other members of the G-7 who, while Buhari visited Germany, opened a new leaf of diplomatic relationship with Nigeria, promising technical and material support to quell the menace of the terrorists and rebuild the Nigerian economy. As he got the support of the international community, Buhari, back at home, altered the strategy against Boko Haram by changing the service chiefs, and ensuring that the entire operation gets daily monitoring with the military heads now based in Maiduguri, Borno State capital. The President, also, in order to strengthen the nation's security architecture, approved the recruitment of 10,000 operatives into the Nigerian Police which complemented Buhari's vision of building a robust and responsive domestic security outfit. Economy At the outset of his administration, the President approved an intervention fund to pay public servants owed salaries across the states due to the fall in revenue. Buhari's intervention was principally to alleviate the suffering of Nigerians and reduce the level of poverty in the country. Apart from the intervention, funds into the Federation Account witnessed a substantial jump in the month of July, 2015, largely due to the plugging of leakages. The jump was in spite of fall in oil revenue. Electricity has improved significantly since the President assumed office on May 29, 2015. The biggest beneficiaries of this, of course, are the Small and Medium Enterprises, SMEs. Buhari's ascension has also improved the country's foreign reserves to $31.5 USD in spite of the falling global prices of commodities. From an initial $29.2 USD, the foreign reserves grew to $31.5, further securing the economy against global and domestic shocks. The change in the leadership of the NNPC was a major stride in restructuring the organization. The appointment of a new Group Managing Director and the slice of Executive Directors from eight to four by the President has repositioned the organization. Closely linked, some refineries in the country have started operations. Kaduna and Port Harcourt refineries are producing at 60 percent capacity, hoping to close-up after a Turn Around Maintenance (TAM). Warri refinery is expected to start operation early next year. Now, fuel queues have gradually faded out at filling stations, especially in Abuja and Lagos where the queues lasted for a while after the inauguration. One area where Buhari received accolades within the country was his ordering of the fast-track of the Ogoni clean-up, acting on a United Nations Environmental Project Report that had been stalled by previous administrations. To further demonstrate his penchant for fairness and justice, the President directed the CBN to clear all outstanding allowances of former Niger Delta militants studying in various institutions across the world. The delay in the payment of the allowances had left the Amnesty Programme hanging on a cliff. He also rejigged the Amnesty Programme by changing the leadership, and giving it a new vision of catering for the weak, the poor and the vulnerable. That move was well received by the people of the Niger-Delta. There used to be Federal Government delegation to Saudi Arabia for annual hajj which, usually, gulped millions of naira. The President has since stopped it. By this decision, the government saved about one million U.S dollars and N30m in local expenses. Corruption Striking at the heart of corruption, Buhari ordered the closure of multiple accounts in MDAs and a reduction to the use of Single Treasury Account to promote transparency and accountability. After three days visit, the President was able to harmonize Nigeria's relationship with the United States, which faltered under the immediate past administration. The United States, as a result of the visit, promised more support for Nigeria in terms of technical, military and intelligence support to end insurgency in the North-East. The result of the improved relations between the two countries saw the released evidence by the United States of massive looting and links of monies wired out of the country. The President has directed prosecution. The meeting in the United States also attracted N2.7 trillion investments into Nigeria. On corruption, the impression of Buhari as incorruptible and the fear of prosecution pushed many to return stolen public funds, with reports saying key actors in the immediate past government have returned huge sums of money. He has meanwhile set up an advisory committee on war against corruption to design an effective template for fighting corruption Buhari's leadership has been religiously focused on cutting down the cost of governance while channeling scarce resources to the areas of priority; thus, government's official travels have been reviewed so that public officers no longer embark on frivolous foreign trips. He also cancelled oil swap deals that had cost the country billions of dollars; resulted in fuel queues due to differences in figures and muddled the country's reputation multiple interpretations and reported high level corruption. The change in administration saw the monetary value of finished goods and services produced in Nigeria in the second quarter of 2015 recording 2.57 percent growth, says data on Quarterly Gross Domestic Product estimates of the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics. In real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 90.20 percent to the nation's overall GDP, marginally higher than both the 89.55 percent share recorded in the first quarter of 2015, and 89.24 percent recorded in the corresponding period of 2014.."
200312020870.html	'NIGERIAN and Cameroun officials yesterday began a crucial meeting in Yaounde, Cameroun. The meeting is to ensure that the rights of people in areas the two countries are to hand over to each other are protected. As part of the Oct. 10, 2002 International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling on the boundary dispute between the two countries, Nigeria is to hand over about 33 villages to Cameroun in the Lake Chad Basin area before the end of this month. In its ruling in the case brought by Cameroun, the ICJ ceded the Bakassi Peninsula and some villages along the two countries\' over 1,700 km boundary to Cameroun. The leader of the Nigerian delegation to the Cameroun-Nigeria Mixed Commission, Prince Bola Ajibola said in Yaounde that Cameroun would hand over only the village called Danbure to Nigeria in the first phase of the withdrawal.

201112140191.html	"document By President Goodluck Jonathan Text of budget speech delivered by His Excellency, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, GCFR. President Federal Republic of Nigeria before a Joint Session of the National Assembly, Abuja. Date: Tuesday, 13 December 2011 I am delighted to present the 2012 Federal Budget Proposal before this esteemed Joint Session of the National Assembly. This Proposal comes at the end of a long consultative process with key stakeholders and it translates the development plans of government unveiled in the Transformation Agenda into concrete actions. PROTOCOL 1. I am delighted to present the 2012 Federal Budget Proposal before this esteemed Joint Session of the National Assembly. This Proposal comes at the end of a long consultative process with key stakeholders and it translates the development plans of government unveiled in the Transformation Agenda into concrete actions. 2. This budget is a stepping-stone to the transformation of our economy and country in our walk to economic freedom. This esteemed Assembly would agree that this path would neither be easy nor uncontested; but with a sharp focus, hard work, determination and making careful choices we will overcome. GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 3. In the past year, the global economic recovery slowed down significantly and downside risks are on the increase as many countries, particularly in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), have faced serious challenges leading to fiscal retrenchment and austerity measures in the face of high and rising levels of sovereign debt. 4. The Euro Zone crisis in particular has time and again thrown financial markets into turmoil as several countries in this economic and monetary union continue to face difficulty in servicing their debts. On the other hand, although many emerging and developing countries, like India and China are experiencing relatively robust growth, downside risks remain as well. In fact, global growth projection has continuously been revised downward and is now 4% for 2012-2013. 5. These developments have implications for our economy as, aside from the impact on the inflow of Foreign Direct Investments, they could also lead to lower demand for our primary export commodity. We are living witnesses to the extent of volatility that can afflict the international oil market with prices plummeting from US$147/barrel in July 2008 to about US$38/barrel four months later. Thus, although the oil price is currently over US$100/barrel, there is no guarantee what it would be in the future. 6. We cannot subject the well-being of Nigerians to such large fluctuations and must therefore protect ourselves by managing our finances prudently including by adopting a conservative benchmark oil price for our budgets. 7. There are also uncertainties in the area of international food prices which make it imperative that we take steps to safeguard our position through policies that would promote food security. So far, the Nigerian economy has weathered these storms well but efforts need to be reinforced to ensure macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENT 8. This year marked another milestone in our democratic experience, with the successful elections and peaceful transition. We now need to build on the mandate that Nigerians have entrusted to us to deliver the dividends of democracy through stronger economic reforms to deliver growth and create jobs. I have created an Economic Management Team (EMT) that I chair, and an Economic Management Implementation Team (EMIT) chaired by the Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Minister of Finance, to help us deliver on this economic agenda. 9. The robust growth recorded in the first half of 2011 underscores the resilience of the Nigerian economy and the prudence of our economic policies. Our growth in the 2010-2011 period has been broad-based. 10. The economy recorded impressive growth of 7.85 percent in 2010 and 7.72 percent as of the second quarter of 2011 compared to 5.2% forecast for sub-Sahara Africa. Medium-term prospects are also bright, with real GDP growth projected to remain strong over the period. Furthermore, we intend to pursue a programme of greater fiscal discipline complemented with appropriate monetary policy in order to help stabilize our declining foreign reserve. 11. The non-oil sector continues to be the main driver of growth with increased crop production, growth in wholesale and retail trade and increased financial sector activities backed by the banking sector reforms. Contributions by the oil sector continue to improve as average daily oil production rose to 2.45 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 2.35 million barrels per day in the corresponding period in 2010. 12. At the same time, food inflation has been on a downward trend from 14.1% in October 2010 to 9.7% in October 2011, but it is still a matter of concern as our objective is to move to low or mid-single digit inflation. REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2011 BUDGET SO FAR 13. We are approaching the end of a peculiar fiscal year for our nation. The 2011 Elections, the subsequent inauguration of a new Administration last May and the passage of the 2011 Amendment Budget in May 2011 all affected the implementation of the budget in 2011. Provisional data on the implementation of the 2011 Budget as at October 2011 indicate that revenue performance improved during the year over the situation in 2010. 14. Oil revenue receipts achieved the targeted levels as a result of relatively higher oil prices and production levels than benchmarked while non-oil receipts, though short of the projection for the period, are tending towards the set targets for 2011. As of mid-November, about 67% of the released funds had been utilized and we expect it to reach 70% by the end of December which is fairly good considering the circumstances. You will agree with me that 2010 and 2011 Budgets were relatively expansionary, and we must now inject a dose of caution. 15. With the support of the National Assembly, the Government is determined to pursue a programme of far-reaching fiscal consolidation so as to reduce our deficit and domestic borrowing to more manageable levels. 16. We have introduced measures to actualize this programme in the 2012 fiscal year both in the areas of improved revenue collection, recurrent expenditure reduction and increasing the share of capital expenditure in aggregate spending, in contrast with the trend of recent years. PRIORITIES OF THE 2012 BUDGET 17. At a time when rating agencies are downgrading countries globally, the Outlook on Nigeria was recently upgraded from negative to stable by Fitch Ratings; this was largely a reflection of two things: a) the new economic programme, including the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework that government has put in place with important reforms and a clear programme of fiscal consolidation; b) the successful political transition following the 2011 elections. 18. In furtherance of its efforts, the government has significantly scaled up the flow of resources to key areas of priority including Security, Infrastructure renewal and development (including power and roads), human capital development and food security to give a more inclusive growth and attention to job creation. Yet, there is much that still needs to be done. The Transformation Agenda spells out the strategic direction of my Administration. 19. In this respect, being the first budget under this Agenda, the 2012 Budget has been designed with the theme: fiscal consolidation, inclusive growth and job creation. 20. To achieve the above objectives, we have established four main pillars, namely, (a) Macroeconomic stability; (b) Structural reforms; (c) Governance and institutions; and (d) Investing in priority sectors. Macroeconomic Stability 21. Government is determined to pursue policies that will ensure a stable macroeconomic environment through a strong and prudent fiscal policy, manageable deficits, sustainable debt-GDP ratio of no more than 30%, and single digit inflation, thereby promoting real growth. We believe that these measures would engender a stable and competitive exchange rate and help to reverse the declining trend of our international reserves. 22. Our domestic debt profile has risen sharply in recent years, currently standing at about 16.4% of GDP. This cannot be allowed to continue and become a new burden on our children. So in addition to looking at the expenditure side of our national balance sheet, we are also paying strong attention to the revenue side. 23. In this regard, we have initiated steps to increase revenues by blocking leakages from various sources, improve corporate tax collection, and boost internally generated revenue. We also believe that we should be able to earn a lot more revenue from the maritime sector. As part of the on-going port reforms, government will work vigorously to increase our revenue from maritime and related activities. 24. Starting in 2012 for the medium term, we shall focus on cutting recurrent expenditure to sustainable levels through reducing waste, inefficiency, corruption and duplication in government. Recent reviews of public expenditures provide a basis for taking such measures. In order to make capital spending more effective, government is introducing a new template for analyzing the financial and other factors including the economic rates of return, job creation, and environmental sustainability. 25. Similarly, Government will continue to prioritize its expenditures while focus will be on the completion of viable on-going capital projects. It is our intention to fund and bring the large portfolio of on-going projects to completion in the next few years while also taking on flagship projects already identified in the Transformation Agenda. 26. From 2012, there will also be a robust programme to strengthen our oil reserves base, and increase oil exploration activities in identified inland sedimentary basins, outside the Niger Delta, with the requisite potential for the production of oil and gas, particularly the Chad Basin. Structural Reforms 27. My Administration is pressing forward with key structural reforms. We are implementing the privatization of the power sector based on the Power Roadmap which I unveiled last year. We believe that the power sector can benefit from liberalization and privatization by attracting investors in the same manner as the telecommunications sector has done. In the same vein, government will come up with policies to encourage investment in the downstream sector through liberalization so as to create jobs for our people. 28. We have also embarked on reforming our ports and customs and we intend to continue vigorously on this path so as to reduce the cost of doing business for our private sector actors. No longer are we going to be contented for clearance of goods in our ports to take 3-4 weeks with attendant demurrage and costs while it takes 48 hours elsewhere. 29. In this regard, I have set up a Committee chaired by the Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Minister of Finance with a mandate to remove the bottlenecks at our ports and another Committee made up of private sector users of the ports to monitor implementation. We also intend to work hard to improve the infrastructure at the ports. Other impediments such as those arising from bureaucratic and costly paperwork will also be removed. 30. With regard to the petroleum sector, the Federal Government is conscious of the need to bring the Petroleum Industry Bill debate to conclusion so as to give investors the comfort and policy certainty that they require. My Administration is determined to bring this matter to closure by engaging with all stakeholders and I therefore call on the National Assembly to work with us in this regard. Governance and Building Institutions 31. Our reforms can only endure if they are founded on strong systems and institutions that promote transparency and we are taking steps to strengthen ours. As you are aware, we have already resumed the publication of revenues allocated to the three tiers of Government as this will promote transparency and accountability in the management of public funds. 32. Similarly, the recent passage of the Freedom of Information Act has further strengthened the hands of citizens in monitoring the activities of government and I acknowledge the role of the National Assembly and civil society, in making this a reality. The fight against corruption is a collective responsibility and my Administration will strengthen our anti-corruption agencies such as the EFCC and ICPC to enable them discharge their mandate. Finally, we recognize that we can only succeed in our effort to transform the economy if we have a vibrant civil service and we fully intend to embark on reforming the public service for optimal service delivery. Investing in priority sectors: Creating Jobs 33. Against the background of the above reforms, this Administration will promote job creation and inclusive growth by investing in critical infrastructure, human capital development and security including more support for the police, defence and counter-terrorism operations. We shall also give priority attention to Information and Communications Technology, Solid Minerals development, Manufacturing, Aviation and Creative industries in order to further develop these sectors that are known to be sources of growth and job creation. 34. Let me now comment on a few sectors. The Agricultural sector is being totally transformed to enable us move from traditional farming to modern agriculture as a business both for our small and large-scale farmers. Our objective is to ensure food security whilst also promoting exports in agriculture value chains where we have a comparative advantage. We intend to process and add value to different crops such as rice, cassava, sorghum, oil palm, cocoa, cotton etc. 35. This approach is central to our transformation strategy. Accordingly, this Administration has adopted enabling measures to support the development of private sector-driven marketing institutions, and push for policies that would promote our agriculture to create jobs. 36. To unleash the potential of this sector, the Federal Ministry of Finance has put in place a mechanism to share risks with the banking sector by guaranteeing 70% of the principal of all loans made for supply of seeds and fertilizer by the private sector this season. In addition, to get the inputs to farmers at an affordable cost, we are subsidizing the interest rate on these loans to bring it down from 15% to 7% per annum. The Minister of Agriculture and the Central Bank are collaborating to extend these services for credit availability for the medium term. 37. We are introducing further fiscal policy measures to support the development of the agricultural sector. In this respect, the duty on machinery and certain specified equipment for the sector will, effective January 31st 2012, attract zero duty. We will further look at supportive fiscal policies for the rice and wheat sectors to stimulate domestic production. 38. Government is also introducing policies to encourage the substitution of high quality cassava flour for wheat flour in bread-baking. Bakeries will have 18 months in which to make the transition, and will enjoy a corporate tax incentive of 12% rebate if they attain 40% blending. With effect from March 31st 2012, importation of cassava flour will be prohibited so as to further support this programme. 39. All equipment for processing of high quality cassava flour and composite flour blending will enjoy a duty free regime as incentive to bakers for composite flour utilization. Consultations with the sector to ensure a smooth transition are on-going. 40. It is common wisdom that the best way we can grow our economy and create jobs for our people is for us to patronize Nigerian-made goods. This is why we are introducing enabling policies to drive this process. In this regard, we are introducing fiscal policy measures that will encourage the purchase and utilization of locally produced commodities. 41. From July 1st 2012, wheat flour will attract a levy of 65% to bring the effective duty to 100%, while wheat grain will attract a 15% levy which will bring the effective duty to 20%. 42. Similarly, there will be a levy of 25% on brown rice to bring it to 30%. In addition, to encourage domestic rice production, a levy of 40% will be placed on imported polished rice leading to an effective duty rate of 50%. Effective December 31st 2012, all rice millers should move towards domestic production and milling of rice, as the levy of 50% will be further raised to 100%. Let me add here that no waivers or concessions will be entertained for rice and wheat importation. 43. We have also commenced implementation of the Power Roadmap which aims to create a robust power sector through the privatization of the generation and distribution of power as well as create an enabling environment for investment. Institutional arrangements have been made for a Bulk Trader company to intermediate between power producers and distributors in a market setting, thereby giving Independent Power Producers (IPPs) the confidence to invest in generation capacity. 44. Government, in collaboration with our development partners has created a credit risk management initiative to provide Partial Risk Guarantees (PRG) to give comfort to gas producers in respect of payment. Similarly, effective January 31st 2012, equipment and machinery in the power sector will attract zero duty. 45. The Government recognizes the provision of affordable housing as a social need and, also, a veritable source of socio-economic development and job creation. Owning one's own home is a basic aspiration of every human being, and our people are no different. 46. To this end, based on a new housing policy, Government is working with our development partners to create an effective mortgage finance system in the country and to develop value chains in the building materials segment. This will give the necessary stimulant to the sector to accelerate its development and also help to reduce the cost of construction, thereby energizing the construction industry. 47. It is a well-known fact that government alone cannot solve the infrastructure problem, which is why we have invited the private sector and international investors to partner with us through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements. 48. As estimated in the First National Implementation Plan of the Nigeria Vision 20:2020, we need N32 trillion for the execution of capital projects over a four year-period, of which the private sector is to contribute N13 trillion. In this respect, we are creating the enabling environment to attract private investments by having a clear regulatory framework. 49. Government will, in addition to ongoing critical infrastructure projects, execute new flagship projects with positive multiplier effects across the country through PPP arrangements in the next three years. 50. In our continuing effort to improve on our human development index, we are conscious of the need to avoid the trap of focusing on economic growth as an end in itself, but rather, a means to improved human development through ensuring better health care, education and wealth creation. 51. To this end, my Administration will continue to invest in these sectors to improve on the quality of education for our children especially young graduates from our educational institutions, support Public-Private Partnership arrangements for skills development and improve the quality of our health service delivery. 52. Fellow Compatriots, we recognize that we can only achieve the developmental goals in a secure and peaceful environment. Accordingly, safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the country is at the heart of ongoing reforms in the security sector. As you are aware, we have since commenced strategic programmes to upgrade the skills of officers in the security agencies while modernizing security infrastructure across the country. THE 2012 BUDGET 53. The 2012 budget is based on a set of assumptions reflecting Government's determination to maintain prudence in the face of continued uncertainties in the external environment. Accordingly, the budget is based on the following:  Oil production of 2.48 million barrels per day (mbpd) up from 2.3mbpd for 2011;  Benchmark oil price of US$70/barrel, a cautious revision from the US$75/barrel approved in the 2011 Amended Budget;  Exchange rate of NGN155/US$;  Projected GDP growth rate of 7.2%; and  Projected inflation rate of 9.5%. 2012 Revenue and Expenditure Profile 54. Based on the above assumptions, the Gross federally collectible revenue is projected at N9.406trillion, of which the total revenue available for the Federal Government's Budget is forecast at N3.644 trillion, representing an increase of 9% over the estimate for 2011. Non-oil revenue is projected to grow significantly in 2012 as recent efforts to reform revenue collecting agencies and the implementation of initiatives to further develop non-oil sectors are expected to yield results. 55. The aggregate expenditure proposed for the 2012 fiscal year is N4.749 trillion, which is a modest increase of 6% over the N4.484 trillion appropriated for 2011. I am pleased to note, however, that the declining share of capital is being reversed so it will account for about 28% of total expenditure in 2012 compared to 26% in 2011. We intend to continue on this path so that by 2015, it will have risen to almost 33%. 56. This underscores the need to intensify our efforts to curtail recurrent expenditure, which we have already embarked upon under the policy of fiscal consolidation as evident from the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. The share of recurrent expenditure in the 2012 Budget proposal is 72%, down from 74.4% in 2011, and we intend to continue on this downward trend up to 2015. 57. The aggregate expenditure comprises N398 billion for Statutory Transfers, N560 billion for Debt Service underscoring the real need to address the rising domestic debt profile, and N2.472 trillion for Recurrent (Non-Debt) Expenditure. We are conscious of the need to control the cost of governance. Government will streamline agencies with overlapping mandates as a way to realign public expenditure. 58. In this respect, I have received the preliminary Report of the task force which I set up for this purpose and we shall implement relevant recommendations. We are also pursuing the biometric verification of workers and pensioners as part of our effort to control cost. 59. Capital expenditure has an allocation of N1.32 trillion representing a 15% increase over the amount approved in the 2011 Budget. The emphasis is on the completion of critical infrastructure projects. 60. Based on the above, the fiscal deficit is projected at about 2.77% of GDP in the 2012 Budget compared to 2.96% in 2011. This is within the threshold stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007 and clearly highlights our commitment to fiscal prudence as a way to create more space for the private sector. 61. This will also have a salutary effect on our domestic debt profile, which has risen significantly in recent years. We are determined to rein in domestic borrowing, and through this, ensure that our debt is at a sustainable level. 62. As I mentioned earlier, government has made significant progress in putting the finances of the nation on a sound footing and laying the foundation for rapid and sustainable economic growth. 63. Allocations to some critical sectors of the economy are as follows: Security - N921.91 billion; Power [including Bulk Trader, Nelmco, and Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO)] -N161.42 billion; Works - N180.8 billion; Education [excluding Universal Basic Education Commission, Petroleum Technology Development Trust Fund (PTDF) & Education Trust Fund] - N400.15 billion; Health - N282.77 billion; and Agriculture & Rural Development - N78.98 billion. Others are: Water Resources - N39 billion; Petroleum Resources - N59.66 billion; Aviation - N49.23 billion; Transport - N54.83 billion; Lands & Housing - N26.49 billion; Science & Technology - N30.84 billion; Niger Delta - N59.72 billion; Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) - N45.57 billion and Communications Technology - N18.31 billion. Fiscal Policy 64. Fellow compatriots, you will agree that the budget is not an end in itself but rather, an instrument for the promotion of economic growth, wealth creation, poverty reduction and service delivery to the citizenry. Government desires that we should begin to experience a commensurate increase in gainful employment and social well-being of Nigerians with the rate of economic growth. 65. This Budget seeks to act, not only to create jobs, but to also lay a solid foundation for sustainable economic growth which would deliver the dividends of democracy to our people. In this respect as you may recall, I hosted a retreat in October this year with the organized private Sector (OPS) at which a number of issues including fiscal policy were extensively discussed. 66. I wish to reiterate here that the principal objective of my Administration's fiscal policy in the area of tariffs and trade is to promote industrialization and the growth of the manufacturing and agricultural sectors of the economy and above all to generate employment for Nigerians. 67. As part of the process to realize this objective, we have commenced the review of the 2008-2012 Customs and Excise Tariffs to correct identified anomalies and introduce policies that will help in the promotion of industrialization in the country when the review is concluded. In addition, to ensure a level-playing field for businesses, this Administration, beginning from the 2012 fiscal year, will where necessary, only grant concessions or waivers on a sectoral basis. The focus of any concessions will be on expanding domestic production for local consumption and boosting exports, development of value chains, and boosting employment. 68. The Export Expansion Grant (EEG) scheme has, over the years, contributed significantly in the diversification of the economy through the promotion of non-oil exports. Efforts have therefore reached an advanced stage to review and streamline the Scheme to make it more effective as an instrument for the promotion of non-oil exports. We shall also aggressively pursue economic diplomacy within the framework of ECOWAS to ensure that the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS) achieves its objective of promoting intra- ECOWAS trade and that it is not used as a vehicle for dumping goods in the region. In particular, we shall review the application of the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS) to the oil palm and other sectors. 69. For some time now, especially with the advent of the consolidated salary structure, there has been agitation over the lopsided nature of the Personal Income Tax Act and the fact that the tax free allowances were inadequate. I am pleased to announce that I have signed the Personal Income Tax Amendment Act 2011 into law which amongst others has the benefit of reducing, on the average, taxes paid by low income earners and providing a more equitable tax structure for individuals. This law also provides for Tax Appeal Tribunals to listen to, and address concerns of individual taxpayers as a cost-effective administrative intervention prior to recourse to the courts. 70. Other fiscal changes to be gazetted shortly, include tax waivers on all bonds and related instruments issued by corporate and other tiers of Government, tax rebates as incentive to companies that create jobs, regulations to support taxpayers' self- assessment, and regulations to support the growing quest of those involved in social and community development to get tax incentives for those donating to their causes. 71. As you may recall, Government initiated a new multifaceted National Job Creation Scheme with the provision of seed funding of N50 billion in the 2011 Budget. Implementation of this programme has commenced in earnest. 72. This Administration believes that it is time to give Nigerian youths an opportunity to enjoy the dignity of a job, the support for innovation, the confidence to be an entrepreneur and, the sheer optimism to be an employer of labour along with the security of an income that can contribute to our economic development. We are conscious of the fact that we have the task of transforming the huge potential of our youths into real, tangible outcomes which all of our people can experience and call their own. 73. In this respect, Government is focused on stimulating entrepreneurial activity and setting a framework for young people with creative tendencies to showcase their business acumen, build capacity and create jobs. In this spirit, and to move beyond the conventional paradigm of job creation, the Government, partnering with the organized private sector and our development partners, took bold steps to initiate the Youth Enterprise With Innovation in Nigeria (YouWin) programme which I launched in Abuja in October and has since been launched also across the six geopolitical zones. 74. This programme is targeted to, not only create a new generation of innovative real sector entrepreneurs in Nigeria, but, in the medium term, also generate jobs for youths across the country. 75. I believe that this move will drive the future technological and socio-economic development of our country. YouWin will lead to the creation of about 100,000 jobs through support to our young entrepreneurs. CONCLUSION 76. Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Distinguished Senators, Honourable Members of this esteemed Assembly, the Proposal I lay before you this day seeks to sustain sound macroeconomic growth that will translate to achieving socio-economic transformation, and gainful employment for our people. But, we can only progress in this course and turn our possibilities into reality when we diligently adhere to the implementation of well thought-out and articulated developmental policies. 77. The 2012 Budget, as our collaborative effort, has taken the welfare of Nigerians as top priority. In an environment of global uncertainties and domestic challenges, the strong support of the National Assembly is invaluable for us to achieve our set developmental goals. 78. As we collectively resolve to create a brighter and enduring future for all Nigerians - a future of hope and prosperity not lack, fear or hatred, we must prepare to overcome any adversity that may arise. Accordingly, we must all be determined and committed to follow through with the difficult but balanced choices that we make in piloting the affairs of this great nation. 79. Finally, I wish to appreciate the enduring partnership between the Executive and the Legislature in discharging our shared responsibility for nation-building and I note, with thanks, the patriotism, commitment and support that Distinguished and Honourable Members of this esteemed Assembly have consistently demonstrated. 80. Once again, I encourage us to dialogue openly, frankly and in good faith over the challenges that face us as a nation. It is my hope that the National Assembly will consider and pass the 2012 Budget Proposal expeditiously; and I foresee even more productive collaboration to the benefit of all our people. 81. I am indeed grateful for your kind attention. 82. May God bless you all, and bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.."
201708240518.html	'By Emmanuel Kendemeh The Yaounde continental conference on African integration is taking place at the moment the continent is facing major political, security and socio-economic challenges. "The very future, the very existence of Africa is at stake. We have a globalised world and Africa is being left behind." These are words with which the Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Kwesi Quartey described the current stakes staring Africa during the opening ceremony of the continental conference in Yaounde on August 22, 2017. It is organized under the theme, "The issue of political and socio-economic integration of the African continent : the role of the Pan-African Parliament." Kwesi Quartey further painted the picture of the continent\'s demise when he said, "You find the African children seeking to cross the Sahara on foot, seeking to swim across the Mediterranean Sea, getting drown and trying to find an eldorado in Europe that does not want them." Africa, he said, represents a paradox as the continent has all the wealth but remains poor. The President of Cameroon\'s Senate, Marcel Niat Njifenji who chaired the opening ceremony of the conference as personal representative of President Paul Biya further circumscribed the context within which the conference was taking place. He said, "Our conference opens today within an international context marked by hotbeds of conflict and terrorist attacks which, unfortunately, do not spare our continent." Corroborating the Senate President, the President of the Pan African Parliament, Hon. Roger Nkodo Dang said, Africa is hit by terrorists like Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin region, jihadists in Mali, climate change with the current floods in Sierra Leone as living examples, a series of humanitarian, social, economic and political crises. Africa is still suffering from the fragmentation caused by colonialists, hence the existence of many integration barriers which constitute speed brakes to the continent\'s development. President Biya\'s representative Niat Njifenji used the occasion to reiterate that the African Union reflects a new vision whose objective is an \xab integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in global arena. \xbb He called on parliamentarians from various African countries to work with their political leaders and actors to ensure the implementation of the Yaounde conference recommendations and also ensure that national parliaments adopt laws which continuously seek African integration. According to the Deputy Chairperson of the AU Commission, the solution to the African problems is political, economic and social integration. The conference came at a crucial moment in the life of Africa, he said, adding that it will be an occasion to unblock and unlock the process of African integration. African parliamentarians can help in tackling the stakes by bringing out the issues, propagating them and educating people, Kwesi Quartey stated. J\'aime.'
200506200618.html	"opinion By Thompson Ayodele Lagos  When the G8 members meet next month in Scotland, Africa will be top of the agenda. With the launch of the Commission for Africa, it is obvious that UK Prime Minister Tony Blair wants the current level of poverty in Africa to improve. But Mr Blair is convinced that the problems confronting this continent will be overcome only if more 'aid' is given to the governments of African countries based on past experience, he is likely to be proved wrong. The popular theory of the vicious circle of poverty holds that low incomes did not leave much for saving, leading to a lack of investment and growth. According to the theory, without providing aid to break the so-called vicious circle, development would be a mirage. Mr. Blair clearly leans towards this theory. Recently, he has travelled across the world to seek cancellation of debt and seek new commitments to give more aid to African countries. Part of his game plan is to double aid to African countries from the current $25 billion to $50 billion by the year 2010. The main reason for doling out money to poor countries has remained unchanged for over three decades: poor countries could not develop without being given money. Foreign aid is based on the premise that poor countries lack financial resources to grow. Many are then quick to say development is only possible through the large transfer of financial resources by developed countries. In actual fact, if financial resources were the key to economic development, things should be steaming ahead. For instance, an average African country gets foreign aid to the tune of 13 per cent of its GDP. This translates to a lot of transfer of financial resources from developed countries to poor ones. During the Marshall Plan, transfers were just 2.5 per cent of the GDP of the largest recipients, France and Germany. The Commission for Africa has been hailed as a replica of the Marshall Plan. But it is a misnomer to label current aid efforts as an African brand of the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan aimed to restore the economies of Western Europe, within the framework of democracy and 'free institutions' (property rights, the rule of law and free markets). But the poor nations of Africa have not recently had these institutions. Donors have failed to realize that foreign aid does not go to the miserable people that we see on our television. It ends up among the ruling elites. That explains why ruling elites anywhere in Africa are more prosperous than the people of their countries. To promote the well-being of millions of people in Africa, one must promote unimpeded trade and investment and allow markets to allocate resources and private enterprise to flourish. All these, not foreign aid, are vital to development. The impacts and consequences of aid are usually unpredictable and unwanted. National and international governments, consultants, academics and NGOs have vested interests in the aid business. This is the reason the call for more aid is growing louder than ever. But aid has destroyed the values that held society together in favour of outsiders' definitions of leadership and development. Aside from that, donor countries usually stipulate which project the recipient countries will have to execute, whether it is relevant to the people or not. No wonder many uncompleted and abandoned projects litter the landscape of Africa. It is interesting to note that most of the so-called aid does not leave the donor countries. In many instances it is the donor country that provides consultants, experts and materials thereby denying recipient countries the capability to develop their human resources. In 1996 more than 25 per cent of donor aid from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries was given in the form of technical cooperation. In 1997 more than 50 per cent of the $26 billion made available in global overseas development assistance by the EU member states was tied to goods and services from donor country companies. In the end, recipient countries cannot properly utilize financial resources they get as donors forbid them from buying goods from markets other than those of the donor even when the prices are not competitive. So where does this leave Africa? The Doha Development Agenda provides African countries with one route out of poverty. Under Doha, the EU, USA, Japan and other developed countries agreed to phase out all forms of export support, reduce trade-distorting policies and grant market access to products from developing countries. If developed countries follow through on their commitments, hundreds of millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America would benefit. According to the World Trade Organization Report 2003, between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of exports of countries such as Nigeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Malawi, Mali, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe are affected by trade-distorting policies in developed countries thereby displacing Africa from international market. The USA, for example, continues to depress the price of cotton. Tariff and non-tariff barriers in OECD countries amount to $160 billion a year. For instance under tariff escalation, cocoa-bean farmers in Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire can export cocoa beans to Japan duty-free or to Korea at a two per cent tariff. However, if the same farmers were to produce and export cocoa powder they would be slammed with tariffs of up to 30 per cent in Japan and 40 per cent in Korea. One continues to wonder why Prime Minister Blair does not use the same zeal and commitment which he now devotes to promoting foreign aid and debt cancellation to call instead for the phase-out of trade distorting subsidies and tariffs among his allies. That effort alone would do far more to improve the lives of millions of poverty-stricken people in Africa than any amount of foreign aid. Poverty in Africa cannot be reduced through government-to-government financial transfers, which never trickle down. This kind of 'aid' perpetuates poverty, promoting poor government policies and corruption, rather than promoting real and lasting economic growth. Sadly, this will be the outcome of the current effort. Ayodele is the Coordinator of the Institute of Public Policy Analysis based in Lagos."
200401220775.html	'By Adaobi Okafor Nigeria industrialists are hopeful for increase in the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the country in 2004. According to them, with the effort of government and that of members of the business communities in promoting trade and investment in 2003, there is hope for growth in investment inflow for this year. The Managing Director of Formosa Bottling Co. Limited, Mr. Frank Lin told Vanguard that with the democratic government, countries in both Europe and America are beginning to trust the future of Nigeria\'s economy in areas of investment. He added that his experience in Nigeria has enabled him to identify and appreciate the great potentials of the country as well as its natural and human resources. According to him, because of the boost in fiscal incentive and government desire to boost the industrial sector there is a lot of hope for more investors to come in this year. The Executive Officer of Lead bank, Chief Bimbo Olashore on his part had noted that international trade between Nigeria and other countries as well as foreign investments in emerging democracies will boost confidence in Africa this year. He said that Nigeria will also gain from its role as a growing and relatively stable supplier of oil but he warned that governance, corruption and HIV/AIDS will be the highest problem in sub Saharan Africa. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), reported that Nigeria recorded $1.3 billion in Foreign Direct Investment inflows being the second largest benefitting top 10 countries in Africa, yet its impact on the economy remained low, a situation attributed to poor economic fundamentals, uneven distribution of wealth and infrastructure. The FDI to Nigeria was highly concentrated in the oil and gas sector, leaving other sectors of the economy virtually undeveloped, a situation the director, United Nations Information Centre Nigeria, Mr. Finjap Njinga said do not augur well for the growth and development of the country. UNCTAD stated that there was a significant decline in global FDI inflows from $1.4 trillion in 2000 to $651 billion in 2002 while FDI inflows into Africa in 2002 declined by 41 percent, from $19 billion in 2001 to $11 billion in 2002 . According to the United Nations, "this occurred at a time of worldwide slumps in FDI flows and largely reflected two cross-border Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) in South Africa and Morocco in 2001, of a magnitude not repeated in the region in 2002."
